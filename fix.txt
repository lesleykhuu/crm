2. fixed zoom after it gets too small
3. homepage inputs outside margins
	removeColumn delete button too big on editTable. why does that happen. the form on addColumn has some padding on it?
--------4. make navigation bar for editTable nicer. change buttons when on page to make it look clicked
	http://www.w3schools.com/website/web_spa_navigation.asp     look at css border-radius
5. how to change the css of the tab
--------6. how to not change pages. dont want to use bootstrap for nav tab

removecontact messed up

--------1. refresh with info on signup.php will log you in
--------7. get rid of contactid and user table
8. make row clickable to edit/remove
--------9. removeField2 => drop does not work
--------10. edit contact makes everything blank if theres no input
--------make actualcontactedit not new page
--------11. bug with @ symbol for signup. does not create table


						there were 22 null rows added

						default table
						userid first last email
						1 		lesley khuu lkhuu 
						2		bob	  lee 	blee
						edit table
						add company -> alter table contactlist add $field varchar(100)
						insert into `fields` (userid, fieldname) values($userid, fieldname)



									$sql = "INSERT INTO `$user`(`user`, `firstname`, `lastname`, `email`) VALUES ('$user','$firstname','$lastname','$email')"; 




						table
						uesrid first last email company
						1 		lesley khuu lkhuu NULL
						2		bob		lee blee	NULL




--------if you remove field from user 1 and they have info, then you readd it, data may still exist in that column if the column does not get deleted from contactlist.
--------deleting same column causes problems.


--------fixed bug. deleted all columns from all users when you delete a column from one user.

created a new Table class in Table.php. used in welcome.php, contactedit, removecontact to print table and addfield and remove field to print fields
still trying to clean up code.

Removed initcontactcreate. only contactcreate is needed now 





1. allow N/A for contactedit
2. make row clickable to edit/remove
3. add scrollbars once windows become too long
4. can't order table labels
5. make row clickable to edit/remove
6. maybe Cleanup contactedit2 and contactcreate
7. fixed zoom after it gets too small
----------8. homepage inputs outside margins
	removeColumn delete button too big on editTable. why does that happen. the form on addColumn has some padding on it?

----------3. make removeField2 redirect to editTable but nav tab on remove field
		fixed this but used sessions to check if its on remove or not. then echo the correct format to page. is this the right way to do it


backedn
fix so you can add "user" as a field. right now user exists already cause of the user column in contactlist



ASK DAVID		data attributes in html. sort rows based on firstname data attribute
	css loads slowly. only works if you add <script> </script> with a space inbetween. in contactcreate

cleanup -> make more classes. more generic
make header

fix margins
